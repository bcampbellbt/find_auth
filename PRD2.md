# Product Requirements Document: macOS System Settings Authorization Discovery Tool

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for developing a macOS System Settings Authorization Discovery Tool designed to comprehensively identify and catalog all authorization requests within macOS System Settings. The primary objective is to enhance BeyondTrust EPM testing coverage by ensuring complete visibility into authorization requirements across supported macOS versions.

The solution will systematically navigate through every clickable option in System Settings, detect authorization requests, and provide detailed reporting through a Flask web application dashboard.

## 2. Problem Statement

BeyondTrust EPM requires comprehensive coverage of all macOS authorization requests to ensure proper endpoint protection. Currently, identifying all authorization points in System Settings is a manual, time-intensive process that:

- **Lacks comprehensive coverage** across all System Settings panes and sub-menus
- **Misses newly introduced authorization points** in macOS updates
- **Provides inconsistent results** across different macOS versions
- **Cannot scale efficiently** for regular testing across multiple OS versions
- **Lacks centralized reporting** for EPM testing teams

## 3. Objectives

### Secondary Goals
- **Baseline Establishment**: Create authorization baseline for supported macOS versions
- **Change Detection**: Track authorization evolution across macOS updates
- **Testing Efficiency**: Reduce manual authorization discovery effort by 90%
